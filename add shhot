# DIRECTOR'S BRIEF
## AXONEM PARIS — "DARKNESS" COLLECTION CAMPAIGN

---

## CREATIVE VISION

### The Concept
This isn't a fashion video. This is a **statement of identity.**

The "Darkness" collection embodies the raw, unfiltered confidence of those who don't seek approval—they command presence. This shoot captures that energy: calm, controlled, and unapologetically powerful.

**We're not selling clothes. We're offering membership to a mindset.**

---

## BRAND PHILOSOPHY

**AXONEM PARIS** sits at the intersection of:
- **Luxury streetwear** — Premium quality, accessible attitude

- **Rebellious elegance** — Refined, not polished; powerful, not loud

### The "Darkness" Collection
- **Oversized acid-wash tees** with haunting graphic print
- **Matching drawstring shorts** in complementary tones
- **Signature element:** Face graphic + bold red "DARKNESS" text
- **Unisex design** — Inclusive, not gendered

**Target Audience:**
- Age: 18-30
- Mindset: Confident, individualistic, culturally aware
- Values: Authenticity over trends, quality over quantity
- Inspiration: Underground music, art, urban culture

## VISUAL LANGUAGE

## TALENT DIRECTION

### The Characters
These aren't "models"—they're **embodiments of the brand.**

**MALE MODEL:**
- **Energy:** Quiet confidence, understated power
- **Not:** Aggressive, performative, trying too hard
- **Think:** "I don't need to prove anything"
- **Movement:** Slow, deliberate, grounded
- **Gaze:** Direct or distant—never apologetic

**FEMALE MODEL:**
- **Energy:** Controlled intensity, self-possessed
- **Not:** Seductive, soft, submissive
- **Think:** "I walk through this world on my terms"
- **Movement:** Fluid but intentional, never rushed
- **Gaze:** Unwavering, penetrating, present

### Chemistry
- **Relationship:** Partners, not lovers. Equals, not rivals.
- **Dynamic:** Shared mindset—"we're cut from the same cloth"
- **Interaction:** Minimal. They don't need to touch or look at each other to feel unified.
- **Vibe:** Two people who understand the same unspoken truth

### Expression Guide
**DO:**
- Relax the jaw (tension shows)
- Soften the eyes without "smiling" with them
- Breathe naturally (this reads on camera)
- Own the space—don't just stand in it

**DON'T:**
- Force "fierceness" (it looks contrived)
- Over-pose (we want real, not editorial)
- Rush movements (slow is powerful)
- Break character between takes (stay in the mood)

## CINEMATOGRAPHY APPROACH

### Camera Philosophy
**"Let the clothing breathe. Let the models command."**

We're creating **cinematic portraits**, not fast-paced hype content.

### Shot Principles
1. **Slow motion = Emphasis**
   - Use selectively (not every shot)
   - Highlight fabric movement, hair flow, deliberate steps
   - 120fps for key hero moments

2. **Low angles = Power**
   - Position camera below eye level for dominance
   - Creates monument-like presence
   - Use for establishing shots and hero frames

3. **Close-ups = Intimacy**
   - Show texture, emotion, detail
   - Build connection between viewer and garment/model
   - Don't overuse—earn them with wide shots first

4. **Static vs. Movement**
   - Static: Confidence, control (hero frames)
   - Movement: Energy, transition (tracking shots)
   - Handheld: Raw moments (minimal, subtle)

### Lens Strategy
- **Wide (24-35mm):** Establishing shots, environmental context
- **Standard (50mm):** Natural perspective, conversational distance
- **Portrait (85mm):** Close-ups, flattering compression
- **Macro (100mm):** Texture details, print close-ups

**Avoid:** Fisheye, extreme telephoto (not our aesthetic)

## LIGHTING PHILOSOPHY

### "Darkness isn't the absence of light—it's the mastery of shadow."

**Lighting Goal:** Sculpt the models and fabric, don't just illuminate them.

### Key Principles
1. **Directionality**
   - Light should have a source and direction
   - Avoid flat, even lighting (too commercial)
   - Embrace shadows—they add dimension

2. **Contrast**
   - Aim for 3:1 to 4:1 lighting ratio
   - Dark darks, controlled highlights
   - Skin should have form, not glow

3. **Color Temperature**
   - Neutral to cool (5000K-5600K base)
   - Red accent: 3200K gelled or RGB tube
   - Avoid warm tones (contradicts "Darkness" mood)

4. **Atmosphere**
   - Haze/smoke adds depth and light texture
   - Rim lighting separates subject from background
   - Negative fill (black bounce) deepens shadows

### Red Accent Light
**Purpose:** Echo the "DARKNESS" red branding without overpowering.

**Placement Options:**
- Background element (subtle glow)
- Rim light on one side (edge definition)
- Practical in-frame (neon tube, LED strip)

**Intensity:** 20-30% of key light power (accent, not dominant)

## SOUND & MUSIC DIRECTION

### Audio is 50% of the Experience

**Music Selection Criteria:**
- **Tempo:** 60-80 BPM (slow, heavy, hypnotic)
- **Texture:** Bass-forward, minimal percussion
- **Mood:** Dark, atmospheric, not aggressive
- **Structure:** Build slowly, breakdown for key moments

### Sound Design Elements
- **Bass:** Deep 808s or sub-bass (physical, felt)
- **Ambient:** Pads, drones, reversed elements
- **Percussion:** Sparse hi-hats, trap snares (minimal)
- **Texture:** Vinyl crackle, tape hiss (analog warmth)
- **Silence:** Use pauses—let moments breathe

### Sync Points
**Critical Beat Markers:**
- **0:05** — First kick = model steps into frame
- **0:15** — Beat drop = dual stance reveal
- **0:31** — Breakdown = flash cut sequence begins
- **0:50** — Fade out = tagline/logo reveal

**Why This Matters:** Music sync creates subconscious impact. Random cuts feel amateur; beat-synced edits feel intentional and professional.

---

## POST-PRODUCTION VISION

### Editing Style
**Pace:** Deliberate, not frantic
- Shots hold for 2-5 seconds (let viewer absorb)
- Flash cuts used sparingly (impact moments only)
- Transitions: Hard cuts (no dissolves, no wipes)

**Rhythm:** Match the music's energy
- Slow sections: Longer takes, smooth camera movement
- Intense sections: Quick cuts, static frames
- Final act: Hold key frames longer for power

### Color Grading
**Look:** Moody cinematic, not oversaturated streetwear hype

**Technical Targets:**
- **Contrast:** High (crushed blacks, controlled highlights)
- **Saturation:** -10 to -20% (desaturated, not monochrome)
- **Shadows:** Lift slightly to preserve detail, then crush
- **Highlights:** Roll-off to avoid clipping
- **Skin Tones:** Natural but slightly cooler
- **Red Channel:** Boost selectively on "DARKNESS" text
- **Grain:** Add subtle 16mm film grain (texture, not noise)

**LUT Reference:** Kodak 2383 (filmic), Fuji Eterna (muted), or custom desaturated grade

### VFX & Graphics
**Minimal and intentional.**

**Text Overlays:**
- "AXONEM PARIS" — Bold sans-serif, white
- "Born from Darkness" — Same font, white or red
- Animation: Simple fade or glitch effect (2-3 frames)
- Placement: Lower third or centered, never cluttered

**Optional Effects:**
- Frame flicker on beat drops (1-2 frames)
- RGB split/chromatic aberration (subtle, not overdone)
- Vignette (soft, don't overdo)

**Avoid:**
- Lens flares (too cliché)
- Overly digital effects (keep it organic)
- Animated text (too playful for this mood)

## BEHIND-THE-SCENES STRATEGY

### Content Beyond the Main Reel

**BTS Footage to Capture:**
1. **Setup shots** — Lighting rigs, haze machines (shows production value)
2. **Model prep** — Candid moments getting into character
3. **Director's POV** — Handheld monitor footage during takes
4. **Detail focus** — Close-ups of fabric being adjusted
5. **Team moments** — Crew working (humanizes the brand)

**Why BTS Matters:**
- Builds brand narrative (we care about craft)
- Extends content lifespan (Stories, feed posts, TikTok)
- Engages audience (they want to see the process)
- Establishes credibility (professional production = premium brand)

**BTS Posting Strategy:**
- **Instagram Stories:** Raw clips with "Behind the Darkness" text
- **TikTok:** "POV: Shooting a luxury streetwear campaign"
- **Instagram Feed:** Curated BTS carousel with polished editing
- **YouTube/IGTV:** Extended 2-3 min "Making Of" video

## COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

### Lighting Mistakes
- **Too bright:** We want mood, not product photography
- **Too flat:** Shadows create dimension—embrace them
- **Inconsistent color temp:** Match all lights or intentionally contrast
- **Over-haze:** Atmosphere enhances; fog obscures

### Direction Mistakes
- **Over-directing:** Let models find the vibe naturally
- **Generic poses:** "Give me fierce" rarely works—be specific
- **Ignoring rhythm:** Movement should match music energy
- **Forcing smiles:** Stay true to the "no smiles" directive

### Editing Mistakes
- **Too fast:** Rushed pacing undermines the moody vibe
- **Over-cutting:** Let shots breathe (2-3 seconds minimum)
- **Music mismatch:** Wrong track ruins the entire piece
- **Over-grading:** Color correction should enhance, not overwhelm

### Brand Mistakes
- **Too trendy:** Timeless > viral (we're building legacy)
- **Unclear messaging:** Every frame should scream "AXONEM PARIS"
- **Generic captions:** Your words matter as much as visuals

## SUCCESS METRICS

### Does This Reel Work?
Ask these questions after the first cut:

1. **Would I stop scrolling for this?** (First 2 seconds test)
2. **Do I understand the brand?** (Clarity of identity)
3. **Do I feel something?** (Emotional resonance)
4. **Would I want to wear this?** (Aspiration factor)
5. **Is it shareable?** (Social currency test)

If the answer to any is "no," iterate.

### Performance Targets (Post-Launch)
- **Instagram Reels:** 50K+ views, 8%+ engagement rate
- **TikTok:** 100K+ views (algorithm-dependent)
- **Saves/Shares:** High ratio = aspirational content
- **Website Traffic:** Track link clicks from bio
- **Conversions:** Monitor sales tied to campaign period

## FINAL DIRECTOR'S NOTE

**Remember:**

This isn't just a campaign—it's the **visual manifesto** of AXONEM PARIS.

Every shot, every light, every second of slow-motion matters. We're not chasing trends. We're setting them.

The "Darkness" collection is for those who:
- Don't follow the crowd
- Don't apologize for their presence
- Don't need external validation

Your job as director is to **capture that truth visually.**

Stay true to the mood. Trust the process. Let the clothing and models do the talking.

**When in doubt, ask:**
"Is this Born from Darkness?"

If yes, shoot it.  
If no, cut it.

**AXONEM PARIS — Born from Darkness.**

Let's create something unforgettable.
